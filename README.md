# dbl-click-select-inside-brackets package

Lots of code editors include the ability to select everything inside a matched pair of opening and closing brackets by double-clicking the opening or closing bracket.

Atom has the excellent [bracket-matcher](https://atom.io/packages/bracket-matcher) package, which allows you to do this with the ctrl-cmd-m key combination, but I missed the double-click so much that I wrote a plugin to add it.

This package currently supports these bracket characters: () [] <> {} 

Enjoy!
